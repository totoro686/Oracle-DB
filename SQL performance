1. The key to correct join order is to keep the intermediary row-set sizes as small as possible throughout query execution.
   
   â€¢	If a strategy was to use LEAST NUMBER OF ROWS rather than LEAST PERCENTAGE OF ROWS as the method for reducing workload, 
   then it would tend to pick smaller tables over larger tables as driving tables regardless of filtering criteria.


2. for the using of hard parse and soft parse in data warehouse
   in the oracle, we should avoid to use soft parse, but in the Data warehouse, we do not recommend to avoid to use hard parse. for example
   for the different site, like HK and MY. In the HK site, we have more than 1,000,000,000 data volumn, but in the MY site, we just have
   100,000 data volumn. If we use the soft parse, it will have the same execution plan, but it will cause some problem.
