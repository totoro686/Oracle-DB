The DBMS_ERRLOG package provides a procedure that enables you to create an error logging table so that DML operations can 
continue after encountering errors rather than abort and roll back. This enables you to save time and system resources.

CREATE_ERROR_LOG Procedureï¼šThis procedure creates the error logging table needed to use the DML error logging capability. 
LONG, CLOB, BLOB, BFILE, and ADT datatypes are not supported in the columns.
